👋 Hi, I’m Lakshmi!

🇮🇳 I’m a 26 year old from India

💻 I’m currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science and Software Engineering

💼 I'm a former employee of Cerner Healthcare Solutions and Philips India Limited

⚡ Fun fact: I took math very seriously as a kid, so much so that I graduated from UCMAS Abacus at the age of 9
